	Abstract = {The single-phase liquid argon time projection chamber   (LArTPC) provides a large amount of detailed information in the form   of fine-grained drifted ionization charge from particle traces. To   fully utilize this information, the deposited charge must be   accurately extracted from the raw digitized waveforms via a robust   signal processing chain.  Enabled by the ultra-low noise levels   associated with cryogenic electronics in the MicroBooNE detector,   the precise extraction of ionization charge from the induction wire   planes in a single-phase LArTPC is qualitatively demonstrated on   MicroBooNE data with event display images, and quantitatively   demonstrated via waveform-level and track-level metrics.  Improved   performance of induction plane calorimetry is demonstrated through   the agreement of extracted ionization charge measurements across   different wire planes for various event topologies.  In addition to   the comprehensive waveform-level comparison of data and simulation,   a calibration of the cryogenic electronics response is presented and   solutions to various MicroBooNE-specific TPC issues are discussed.   This work presents an important improvement in LArTPC signal   processing, the foundation of reconstruction and therefore physics   analyses in MicroBooNE.},

	Abstract = {We describe the concept and procedure of drifted-charge   extraction developed in the MicroBooNE experiment, a single-phase   liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC). This technique   converts the raw digitized TPC waveform to the number of ionization   electrons passing through a wire plane at a given time.  A robust   recovery of the number of ionization electrons from both induction   and collection anode wire planes will augment the 3D reconstruction,   and is particularly important for tomographic reconstruction   algorithms.  A number of building blocks of the overall procedure   are described. The performance of the signal processing is   quantitatively evaluated by comparing extracted charge with the true   charge through a detailed TPC detector simulation taking into   account position-dependent induced current inside a single wire   region and across multiple wires.  Some areas for further   improvement of the performance of the charge extraction procedure   are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The precise measurement of neutrino properties is among the highest priorities in fundamental particle physics, involving many experiments worldwide. Since the experiments rely on the interactions of neutrinos with bound nucleons inside atomic nuclei, the planned advances in the scope and precision of these experiments require a commensurate effort in the understanding and modeling of the hadronic and nuclear physics of these interactions, which is incorporated as a nuclear model in neutrino event generators. This model is essential to every phase of experimental analyses and its theoretical uncertainties play an important role in interpreting every result. In this White Paper we discuss in detail the impact of neutrino--nucleus interactions, especially the nuclear effects, on the measurement of neutrino properties using the determination of oscillation parameters as a central example. After an Executive Summary and a concise Overview of the issues, we explain how the neutrino event generators work, what can be learned from electron--nucleus interactions and how each underlying physics process -- from quasi-elastic to deep inelastic scattering -- is understood today. We then emphasize how our understanding must improve to meet the demands of future experiments. With every topic we find that the challenges can be met only with the active support and collaboration among specialists in strong interactions and electroweak physics that include theorists and experimentalists from both the nuclear and high energy physics communities.},

The goal of the project is to develop a `canonical' neutrino interaction physics Monte Carlo whose validity extends to all nuclear targets and neutrino flavors from MeV to PeV energy scales. Currently, emphasis is on the few-GeV energy range, the challenging boundary between the non-perturbative and perturbative regimes, which is relevant for the current and near future long-baseline precision neutrino experiments using accelerator-made beams. The design of the package addresses many challenges unique to neutrino simulations and supports the full life-cycle of simulation and generator-related analysis tasks. GENIE is a large-scale software system, consisting of ∼120000 lines of C++ code, featuring a modern object-oriented design and extensively validated physics content. The first official physics release of GENIE was made available in August 2007, and at the time of the writing of this article, the latest available version was v2.4.4.},

We also discuss bounds on the presence of antimatter in the present-day universe, including the possibility of a large lepton asymmetry in the cosmic neutrino background. We briefly review the theoretical framework within which baryogenesis, the dynamical generation of a matter--antimatter asymmetry, can occur. As an example, we discuss a testable minimal particle physics model that simultaneously explains the baryon asymmetry of the universe, neutrino oscillations and dark matter.},

	Annote = {The low-noise operation of readout electronics in a liquid   argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) is critical to properly   extract the distribution of ionization charge deposited on the wire   planes of the TPC, especially for the induction planes.  This paper   describes the characteristics and mitigation of the observed noise   in the MicroBooNE detector. The MicroBooNE's single-phase LArTPC   comprises two induction planes and one collection sense wire plane   with a total of 8256 wires.  Current induced on each TPC wire   is amplified and shaped by custom low-power, low-noise ASICs   immersed in the liquid argon.  The digitization of the signal   waveform occurs outside the cryostat.  Using data from the first   year of MicroBooNE operations, several excess noise sources in the   TPC were identified and mitigated.  The residual equivalent noise   charge (ENC) after noise filtering varies with wire length and is   found to be below 400 electrons for the longest wires (4.7 m). The response is consistent with the cold   electronics design expectations and is found to be stable with time   and uniform over the functioning channels. This noise level is   significantly lower than previous experiments utilizing warm   front-end electronics.},

	Abstract = {We describe a method based on the CLs approach to present results in searches of new physics, under the condition that the relevant parameter space is continuous. Our method relies on a class of test statistics developed for non-nested hypotheses testing problems, denoted by ΔT, which has a Gaussian approximation to its parent distribution when the sample size is large. This leads to a simple procedure of forming exclusion sets for the parameters of interest, which we call the Gaussian CLs method. Our work provides a self-contained mathematical proof for the Gaussian CLs method that explicitly outlines the required conditions. These conditions are milder than that required by Wilks' theorem to set confidence intervals (CIs). We illustrate the Gaussian CLs method in an example of searching for a sterile neutrino, where the CLs approach was rarely used before. We also compare data analysis results produced by the Gaussian CLs method and various CI methods to showcase their differences.},

@article{pmt_qe,
	Annote = {We present a model for the Global Quantum Efficiency (GQE)   of the MicroBooNE optical units. An optical unit consists of a flat,   circular acrylic plate, coated with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB),   positioned near the photocathode of a 20.2-cm diameter   photomultiplier tube. The plate converts the ultra-violet   scintillation photons from liquid argon into visible-spectrum   photons to which the cryogenic phototubes are sensitive. The GQE is   the convolution of the efficiency of the plates that convert the 128 nm scintillation light from liquid argon to visible light, the   efficiency of the shifted light to reach the photocathode, and the   efficiency of the cryogenic photomultiplier tube. We develop a   GEANT4-based model of the optical unit, based on first principles,   and obtain the range of probable values for the expected number of   detected photoelectrons (NPE) given the known systematic   errors on the simulation parameters. We compare results from four   measurements of the NPE determined using alpha-particle   sources placed at two distances from a TPB-coated plate in a liquid   argon cryostat test stand. We also directly measured the radial   dependence of the quantum efficiency, and find that this has the   same shape as predicted by our model. Our model results in a GQE of   0.0055$\pm$0.0009 for the MicroBooNE optical units. While the   information shown here is MicroBooNE specific, the approach to the   model and the collection of simulation parameters will be widely   applicable to many liquid-argon-based light collection systems.},

	Abstract = {We examine the systematics of deep inelastic neutrino scattering from complex nuclei by computing the cross section for quasi-elastic scattering and for quasi-free resonance production. We retain relativistic kinematics for the recoiling particle and the full relativistic hadronic weak vertex. The isobar cross section is expressed in terms of helicity amplitudes of the weak current, defined through an application of the Jacob-Wick formalism to the general isobar-nucleon weak vertex. The cross section is computed analytically for the nuclear Fermi gas model. We stress that exactly the same model has already been very successfully applied to inelastic electron scattering from complex nuclei.},
